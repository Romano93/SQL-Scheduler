This was a project to finish my apperenticeship as a computer developer.
Feel free to use it, I don't claim any rights on it.

Important: 
- !! DON'T remove the try chatch block: If the service can't do the stuff he needs to, the queue will stop and you have to reset and restart it manualy !!
- you should write an error before the try catch blocks so that you can see if something went wrong. At the moment this isn't the case.
- also, you can only define one day per week at the moment.
